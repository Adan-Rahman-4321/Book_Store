It is designed to handle the core functionalities of an e-commerce platform, including product catalog management, secure user access, and efficient data handling. The application is built with a strong focus on maintainability, scalability, and security using modern architectural principles.
🚀 Key Features & Deliverables
Product Catalog Management: 
Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing book inventory, categories, and author details.
Secure Access:
Implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to secure administrative functions (inventory, order processing) and differentiate access between Admin and Customer roles.
Customer Experience:
Intuitive user interface with dynamic features like product search, filtering, and responsive design for seamless browsing.
Data Integrity: 
Reliable data management ensured through efficient SQL Server database design.
🛡️ Security Implementation
RBAC: User roles (Admin, Customer) are strictly enforced to restrict access to sensitive features (e.g., inventory editing).Password Hashing: Passwords are securely hashed using built-in ASP.NET Identity mechanisms (if used).
